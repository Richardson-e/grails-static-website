## Overview

Database migrations are an important facet of web development. Preserving existing data while seamlessly adding new functionality and tables is critical when making incremental database changes to production applications.

Without a tool to manage database migrations, developers end up cobbling together solutions using manual SQL, error-prone communication processes, and costly risk management strategies.

In this webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> framework, and Micronaut) team member, [Nirav Assar](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#assar), demonstrates how to apply the Grails Database Migration plugin in development and production.
