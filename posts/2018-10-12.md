## Overview

In this webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> framework, and Micronaut) team member, [Sergio del Amo Caballero](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#caballero), demonstrates the multi-tenancy capabilities built into the Grails framework and GORM.

Multi-tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in such a way that each tenant's data is isolated from the other. Among other things, multi-tenancy enables you to build software as a service (SaaS) applications.

Grails developers interested in learning how to integrate multi-tenancy in their applications will get an introduction to the Grails framework's multi-tenancy capabilities and an in-depth demonstration of how to implement this powerful functionality.

## Outline

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Supported multi-tenancy modes (database, schema, discriminator)
- The Grails framework's built-in tenant resolver
- How to build your own tenant resolver
- How to build a custom tenant resolver by logged-in user
- How to configure datasources dynamically while using database multi-tenancy

This webinar is an excellent learning opportunity for Grails developers who wish to gain an understanding of Grails multi-tenancy capabilities and the possibilities therein.
