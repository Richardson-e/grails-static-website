## We're all about sharing it back.

The Object Computing Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut team is collecting tips to compile into a resource that the global developer community can benefit from. By sharing your tips, you can help your peers build better solutions, making all of us stronger.

## What’s your go-to productivity tool or technique?

No idea is too small! The little tips are often the things that add up to make the biggest difference. Bonus points if the trick isn't documented anywhere – you may be the first person to figure something out!

Highlights from your submissions will be shared with the 2GM community. This is a great chance to help your fellow developers improve their skills ... and who knows? Maybe you'll also win some cool swag!

## Ready to participate?

[Head over to this link](https://objectcomputing.typeform.com/to/j0BdcprA) and give us a peek inside your bag of tricks by sharing executable code, representative code snippets, or prose describing any practical tips you rely on to write better code faster.

Multiple submissions are welcome; we just ask that you have all your ideas submitted by August 31st.

We can’t wait to see all of the cool tips and tricks you've come up with!
