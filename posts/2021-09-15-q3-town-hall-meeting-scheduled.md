Our 2021 third-quarter Town Hall Meeting is just around the corner!

2GM Town Hall Meetings give the Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut team a chance to engage with you and empower you to contribute to the frameworks you love. Each Town Hall Meeting is led by a panel of 2GM users, developers, and advocates, and everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.

We look forward to seeing you on September 24th, where we'll be sharing an update on our Productivity Tips 'n' Tricks guide, chatting about the latest technology releases, and more!
