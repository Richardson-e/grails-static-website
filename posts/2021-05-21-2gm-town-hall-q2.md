A big thanks to everyone who joined us for our Q2 2GM Town Hall Meeting! For those of you who missed the live event, the recording is embedded below.

At this quarter's meeting, we shared updates regarding the Grails and Micronaut roadmaps, discussed changes to the Micronaut Guides, talked about how to become a sponsor of the Grails and Micronaut Foundations, and encouraged qualified community members to apply to join the 2GM engineering team! You can find all of Object Computing's open positions here.

Also, special thanks to our fantastic panel of experts: Jeff Scott Brown, David Estes, Iván López, and Graeme Rocher.

Till next time!
