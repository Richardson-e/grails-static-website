In this short video tutorial, 2GM (Groovy, Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> framework, and Micronaut) team member, [Zachary Klein](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#klein-z), demonstrates how to use the Grails 3 React profile to build Grails applications with a React frontend.

In particular, Zak shows you how to create a single project build, which allows you to mix React code with common Grails-view technologies, such as GSP.

Moreover, he discusses the different Gradle tasks bundled with the profile and the typical workflow you may use while using it.

Grails Quickcasts, brought to you through a partnership between [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) and [DZone](https://dzone.com/), provide bite-sized tutorials to help you maximize your productivity with the Framework.
