## Overview

React is the JavaScript view library from our friends at Facebook. Rather than providing a "full-stack framework" for the front end, React focuses entirely on being the 'V' in MVC.

In this 60-minute webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> framework, and Micronaut) team member, [Zachary Klein](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#klein-z), demonstrates how to leverage React in your projects. You'll learn several ways to use these two frameworks together and get an introduction to the React profile for Grails apps.

## Outline

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Overview of React and build tooling
- 3 Approaches to building Grails projects with React
- The React profile
- Spring Security REST
- Unified deployment

This webinar is a useful tutorial for Grails developers interested in adding React or another front-end framework/library to their projects. Front-end developers are also encouraged to discover what the Grails framework has to offer in a modern web development workflow.
