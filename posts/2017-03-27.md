Today, [the Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) is pleased to announce the release of [GORM 6.1 GA](http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/).

This release includes [a number of new and exciting features](http://gorm.grails.org/latest/whatsNew/manual/index.html) that we are happy to share with you today. Notably:

*   [GORM Data Services](http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices) allow you to easily define interfaces or abstract classes that are automatically implemented for you at compile time.
*   Multi-Tenancy AST Transformations
*   Support for JPA annotations and Bean Validation API annotations
*   Package Scanning for easier unit testing
*   Support for Hibernate 5.2+
*   Automatic HQL escaping for GString queries
*   Support for MongoDB 3.4 and the new Decimal128 Type
*   Support for Neo4j 3.1 and the Neo4j 1.2 Bolt Java Driver
*   Massive improvements to the Neo4j support including support for relationship entities, paths and more.

There is too much goodness to go through all of it in a blog post, so I encourage you to read the [release notes](http://gorm.grails.org/latest/whatsNew/manual/index.html) and check out the dedicated documentation for each implementation:

*   [GORM for Hibernate](http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#releaseHistory)
*   [GORM for MongoDB](http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/mongodb/manual/index.html#releaseNotes)
*   [GORM for Neo4j](http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/neo4j/manual/index.html#releaseNotes)

Or alternatively come see my [talk about GORM 6.1 in person at Greach in Madrid](http://2017.greachconf.com/sessions/gorm-61/)!

GORM 6.1 will become the default version of GORM to be used in the upcoming Grails 3.3, in the meantime you can use GORM 6.1 in Grails 3.2 simply by changing the `gormVersion` setting in `gradle.properties`:

```groovy
gormVersion=6.1.0.RELEASE
```

To celebrate the release we have prepared the first of a series of new guides to cover GORM 6.1\. Among the many new features are huge improvements to support Neo4j. Using the official Neo4j sample application, the new guide describes how you can [build a graph application with the Grails framework, GORM 6.1 and Neo4j](http://guides.grails.org/neo4j-movies/guide/index.html)! Enjoy!
