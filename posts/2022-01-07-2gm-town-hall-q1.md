A big thanks to everyone who joined us for our Q1 2GM Town Hall Meeting! For those of you who missed the live event, the recording is embedded below.

At this quarter’s meeting, we provided an update on the latest advancements with the Grails and Micronaut frameworks, including a look at what is coming soon. We also shared the latest news and sponsors of the Grails and Micronaut Foundations, as well as some great live discussions and Q&A with our panel.

A special thanks to our fantastic panel of experts: James Kleeh, Puneet Behl, Sergio del Amo Caballero, and our awesome guest [Cédric Champeau](http://melix.github.io/blog/).

Till next time!
