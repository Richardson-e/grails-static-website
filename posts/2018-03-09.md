## Overview

GraphQL is an exceptional technology that allows APIs to be more efficient and expressive. GORM is the object relational mapper used by Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> apps that enables developers to interact with both relational and document databases through the declaration of simple Groovy classes.

In this 55-minute webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails framework, and Micronaut) team member, [James Kleeh](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#kleeh), discusses in depth a new GORM extension and Grails plugin that combine these two great technologies and increase developer productivity.
