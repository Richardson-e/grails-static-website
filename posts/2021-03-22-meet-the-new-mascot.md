In February 2021, we introduced the Grails framework's brand new mascot and reached out to our community to give the knight a name. The winner had a chance to win a one-of-a-kind Grails swag bag (and bragging rights, of course).

We were absolutely delighted to see the creativity, enthusiasm, and support the Grails community contributed to our quest. We received an amazing number of responses with some super imaginative suggestions.

So, the community has voted, and the Grails mascot has been named! 

And the knight's new name is …

[Drumroll please …]

Gideon!

The name Gideon was overwhelmingly the top pick. Since multiple people suggested the name, we drew several winners from those entries to receive a swag bag. Please join me in congratulating winners: Joshua Freivald, Joe Little, and Benjamin Suffin! And if you were one of the many people who suggested we name the knight Gideon who didn't win a swag bag, please feel free to enjoy the bragging rights. Every time you see Sir Gideon out there, you'll know you were part of his "Hello World" development.

Huge thanks to everyone who took part in the Name the Knight contest. Even if your name wasn't chosen, your  participation reminded us just how much we love and appreciate the Grails community.
