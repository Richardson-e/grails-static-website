The folks at Slack describe their application as follows:

> A messaging app for teams who are changing the world.

That sounds like us! :)

We set up the Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> Slack channel less than a year ago, and the channel has been very well received by the community. Our Slack channel is a great place to connect with the core Grails development team, as well as thousands of other Grails users, to ask and answer questions and to discuss ideas.

The Grails Slack Channel can be found at [http://grails.slack.com](http://grails.slack.com/). Sign up at [https://slack.grails.org](https://slack.grails.org).
