        <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          At <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/">Object Computing</a>, home to the Grails and Micronaut frameworks, our core values energize and guide us in all that we do. Those values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All of us is better than any one of us</li>
          <li>Innovate courageously</li>
          <li>Share it back</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As part of our commitment to empowering technologists, both within our organization and without, to find inspiration in these values, we invest our resources in open source projects, and through those projects engage with the global open source community.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this collaboration comes the responsibility to communicate expectations, moderate public discourse, and respond to abuse as necessary. By outlining what we expect within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in public Micronaut and Grails forums. Reports of abuse will be investigated, and reports of abuse may result in active moderation of any content that we determine to be in violation of these guidelines.
        </p>
        <h3>Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of Micronaut GitHub Discussions, Micronaut Gitter, and the Grails Slack channel is to discuss and collaborate on Micronaut and Grails technologies and projects. To help maintain a safe, respectful, and productive space for all community members, we expect everyone to adhere to the following guidelines.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be welcoming and open-minded</li>
          <li>Be respectful</li>
          <li>Be civil and professional</li>
          <li>Do not post offensive, abusive, or hate speech</li>
          <li>Do not harass anyone</li>
          <li>Treat others with respect and consideration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prohibited Actions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Threats of violence</li>
          <li>Hate speech and discrimination</li>
          <li>Bullying and harassment</li>
          <li>Impersonation</li>
          <li>Doxxing and invasions of privacy</li>
          <li>Sexual or violent messages or content</li>
          <li>Misinformation and disinformation</li>
          <li>Active malware or exploits</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Responding to Perceived Violations of This Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We cannot always actively monitor community channels for offensive content, so we rely on the community to let us know when an issue needs to be addressed. If you encounter content in one of these forums that you find objectionable or feel violates these guidelines, here are some tools to help you take action immediately:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicate expectations</li>
          <li>Lock conversations</li>
          <li>Block the user</li>
          <li>
            Report the individual to:
            <ul>
              <li>Grails Foundation Board of Directors (foundation@grails.org) for reports of abuse in the Grails Slack channel.</li>
              <li>Micronaut Foundation Board of Directors (foundation@micronaut.io) for reports of abuse in the Micronaut Gitter and Micronaut Github Discussions channels</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When submitting a report, please include as many details as possible, including the individual's name (or screen name), dates and times of the communications you found objectionable, and any actions you took to mediate the situation prior to reporting it.
        </p>
        <h3>Report Follow-Up Procedures</h3>
        <p>
          We'll review each abuse report on a case-by-case basis. In each case, our team will investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actions we may take in response to an abuse report include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content removal</li>
          <li>Content blocking</li>
          <li>Account suspension</li>
          <li>Account termination</li>
        </ul>
