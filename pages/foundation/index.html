                  “For over a decade, Grails has been a leader among JVM web application frameworks.  The innovations in Grails and the longevity of its success have been possible only because of the vibrant and active community around the technology over the years.  The Grails Foundation is being launched in part to acknowledge the role that the community has played all along, and to create a forum to continue growing the enthusiasm of the community.  A core tenet of The Object Computing Team has always been <strong>All Of Us Are Better Than Any One Of Us</strong>, and The Grails Foundation will facilitate the continued embracing of the value in that truth.”
              </span>
              , said Jeff Scott Brown, Grails co-founder and Object Computing Grails Practice Lead.
